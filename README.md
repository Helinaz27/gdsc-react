# 📘 GDSC React Learning Program

This repository documents my learning journey through the **GDSC (Google Developer Student Clubs) React Program**, where I completed weekly hands-on tasks to build foundational and advanced skills in **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Pure CSS**.

## 🚀 Overview

The program was structured across **6 months**, with new tasks introduced weekly and finally we worked on a final project that takes around 2 months to complete. Each task was designed to build practical understanding of core front-end concepts. Weekly sync-ups with React mentors helped guide progress and provided valuable feedback.
